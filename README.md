# Mocker
A docker clone

## About
  - A full docker clone written in C
  - Done to suppliment my deep dive of how docker works on a kernel level
  - Isolates: processes, hostnames, and filesystem
  - Not quite fully functional, does not include network, memory usage, and disk usage, as I didn't believe they were within the scope of my research.
